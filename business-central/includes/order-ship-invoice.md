> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you post an order, you create a shipment and an invoice. These documents can be done at the same time or independently. You can also create a partial shipment and a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual sales order lines before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice for something that is not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have recorded a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.
