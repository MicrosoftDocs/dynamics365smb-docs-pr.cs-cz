Once the invoice has been posted, you can find it in the list of posted invoices. Both the **Posted Sales Invoices** list and the **Posted Purchase Invoices** list show the posted invoices with the final invoice numbers. From the list, you can look up each posted invoice, and you can correct or cancel a posted invoice.  

For each posted invoice, you can look up statistics, dimensions, and the ledger entries that are the result of the posted invoice. You can also print or send the posted invoice.
