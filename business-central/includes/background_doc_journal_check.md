## Check data in documents and journals while you work

In 2022 release wave 1 we introduced a feature that will validate the data you enter in documents and journals while you're entering it. For example, turning on this feature can help avoid mistakes in data entry or not being able to post something due to an error. 

Your administrator can enable the **Feature: Check documents and journals while you work** feature on the **Feature Management** page. Afterward, you will receive a notification when you open a page to start working on a document or journal. To start using the feature, choose the **Enable this for me** link in the notification. 

If you enable the feature, the FactBox Pane will show either a **Check Document** or **Check Journal** FactBox, depending on the type of document you're working on. The FactBox lists the errors on the page so you can quickly resolve them.

If you decide you don't need the feature, there are two ways to turn it off:

* For journals, turn off the **Enable Data Check** toggle on the **General Journal Setup** page.
* For documents, clear the **Show the Document Check FactBox** check box on the **My Notifications** page.
