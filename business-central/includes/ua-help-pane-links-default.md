- A link about the current page

  At the top of the pane, a card shows a short description of the current page, if one exists. If there is no page description, then the card provides a single link to an article about the page.  

  If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, we show the landing page on [Docs.microsoft.com](/dynamics365/business-central). For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  

- Links to related articles from Microsoft Docs  

  These links are related to the current page and will change if you move to another page. The links are limited to the docs.microsoft.com site. If there are more than three links, choose the *Show more* link to expand the card. Choose any link, and the related article will open in a new browser tab.  
- Links to content for apps on the current page  

  These links are based on any app that extends the page or defines the page.  
- Links to other resources

  Three links are always available in the Help pane: Links to the  **Help & Support** page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], the [Keyboard Shortcuts](../keyboard-shortcuts.md) article, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] community.
